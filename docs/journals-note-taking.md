# Journals & note taking

One of the design goals for #tagwiki was good support for journals
and note taking.

Any set of tags can be a journal. Let's say you would like
to take have a work related logs/journal. These can be just a lot
of pages sharing `mycompany` and `journal` tags.

Just create a couple of first notes with these tags. Afterwards, you can easily add a note,
by going to `/mycompany/journal` page and pressing `n`.

The new page editing screen will be pre-populated with the current tags,
so you can just type in your note and save it with `ctrl+enter`.

In many desktop environments you can set up a global shortcut to open
http://localhost/mycompan/journal/?edit=id in your browser. This way you
have a convenient method to create a new note at any time.
