# #Tagwiki #tagging & links


Tag is any text starting with `#` and followed by letters, numbers, dashes and underscores.

Tags are automatically indexed. To link to other pages use normal markdown links referencing the tags used in the pages you want to reference.

Example:

`[All tagwiki help pages](/help/tagwiki)`

will produce:

[All tagwiki help pages](/help/tagwiki)

You can start your link with `/` to reference the global namespace, or without it, to narrow down current-page tags with more tags.


The order of tags in the link is significant, but not critical. The rule of thumb is: try to use the most important and general tags first. Tagwiki will automatically and gracefully handle stale, missing and incorrect tags, so as your pages evolve, all the links should degrade gracefully.
